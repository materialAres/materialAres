# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @materialAres
I'm a nerd, and that's more than anything else I could say. I love the keyboard noise, the screen light (better to set everything with dark mode though!), the mouse click, and of corse to write code! Bad code, yeah. Actually, I'm always trying to improve, learn and stuff like that, so maybe it's not that bad idk.

Anyway, my favorite language is lov... err, I mean JAVA. Yeah, that prolix language full of stuff and things and stuff and things. But I found out I also like frontend! I worked for some time with Angular, and now with Remix. Despite being less popular than Next, Remix is not that bad, trust me (or maybe you shouldn't).

Have a safe trip on the web!
