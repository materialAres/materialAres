# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @materialAres
I'm a nerd, and that's more than anything else I could say. I love the sound of the keyboard, the glow of the screen (though it's better to set everything to dark mode!), the mouse clicks, and of course, writing code! Bad code? Yeah. Actually, I'm always trying to improve, learn, and do stuff like thatâ€”so maybe it's not that bad, idk.

Anyway, my favorite language is lov... err, I mean **Java**. Yeah, that prolix language full of stuff and thingsâ€”and more stuff and things. But Iâ€™ve found that I also like *frontend*! What a lovely surprise... so, I found myself working with with Angular for a while, and now I'm experimenting with Remix. Despite being less popular than Next, Remix isnâ€™t that bad. Trust me (or maybe you shouldnâ€™t).

Well, have a safe trip on the web! ![Rocket](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/687dc9df-1551-41be-a53a-7a4b41ec3684)
